            <h1>My dearest Hayley,</h1>
            <p>I can't believe our little boy is already two months old today. It feels like just yesterday we were bringing him home from the hospital, and now he's becoming more aware, and so much more a part of our world. Watching him grow, with tiny little changes, is the greatest joy of my life.</p>
            <p>It struck me how our butterfly bushes, just like our lives, are full of new growth and beautiful things. Every day, I am amazed at the beautiful new life we've brought into the world and the wonderful family we are building together. It is all so perfect and miraculous.</p>
            <p>Thank you for being the most incredible mother and wife. You have filled our home with so much love and joy, and I am so grateful to share this journey with you. You and our little boy are my everything.</p>
            <p>All my love,</p>
            <p>Ben</p>
